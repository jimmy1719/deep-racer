AWS Deepracer

The AWS Deep racer competition is an intro to AI/ML type activities that let you build a reward function model for an RC car to train with. The car tries to find the optimal path through a race track based on the the rewards you give it. You might reward it for doing different things like "going fast" and "not flying off the track". 

My model balanced going fast and staying on the track with maintaining a heading that aligned with the average heading of the race track.

Proud of this piece of code because my car won a local Deep racer competition!
